Neural network using back propagation machine learning model for disk failure prediction
Junjie Qian, jqian.unl@gmail.com

Input set: 1. read attributes from "configuration" file, format defined; 2. data set format expect as "value1,value2,value3,...,valuen n m value1,...,valuem"(n the input attributes number, m the output attributes number)

Files: "include", all head files; "src" all source files; "obj" all object files; "sample" sample configure file and train/test datasets; "testing" testing files

This work is part of our paper published on IEEE NAS 2015 and later reported by TechRepublic (http://goo.gl/eKYKxk).
